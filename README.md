## Introduction

As a project for the Advanced Coding Tools and Methodologies course we developed a Vue.js application that allows the user to build chord progressions and provides him the possible substitution and voicings according to the rules of major scale harmony. It runs in all major browsers, so it's totally cross-platform and available for every desktop OS.

## User Interface

The ChordSchool user interfaces consists of the following two main components:
1. The **Keyboard** that extends over three octaves and is displaying the notes composing the major scale of reference as well as  the placement of fingers over the it for the modal chords in their first position as well as all the possible alterations when applied by the user. 

2. The **control panel** where the user mainly interacts with the application. The user is able to create the chord progression of his choice, by placing a series of chords available from the seven modes of the reference scale. The user can reorder the progression by dragging its elements and hear the final result in different sound environments and configurable playout speed. As the user interacts with the control panel, the keyboard highlights his choices and helps him position himself over the keyboard as a player.

Since our application is considered educational, we chose to visually represent the key references of the major scale harmony, the relative chords and modes in the context of color as well as in the context of placement of fingers over the keyboard as the chord progression is
